# Social Media Sentiment Analysis 📝

**Analyze tweets/Facebook posts to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) using machine learning.**

## 🔍 Overview
- **Purpose**: Build a model to understand sentiment in social media posts.
- **Problem**: Automatically classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Approach**: Clean text, extract features (TF‑IDF or embeddings), train models (Naive Bayes, SVM, optionally BERT/LSTM), evaluate with accuracy/F1-score.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning: remove noise (punctuation, URLs, stopwords), tokenization
- Feature extraction: classic (TF-IDF) or deep (transformers, embeddings)
- Models: Naive Bayes, SVM, optional deep models
- Evaluation: classification metrics, confusion matrices
- Prediction script for new posts

 Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Evaluate multiple models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Transformers) for comparisons.

🔭 Future Work
Fine-tune Transformers (e.g., BERT) for improved accuracy

Add support for sarcasm, emojis, and slang

Deploy as an API or web app for real-time sentiment analysis
